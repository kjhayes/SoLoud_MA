---SoLoud_MA---

This is a redistribution of parts of the SoLoud Audio Library by Jari Komppa, with a miniaudio backend.

This library is meant to compile and install using cmake, and does not include the whole SoLoud library.

It should include source and header files that are needed for the audio backend of the GLEWY library project (https://github.com/kjhayes/Glewy.git).

It may contain some extra files unintentionally.
